    "The book is aimed at students with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving. Students who wish to really learn the material will have to spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to help students learn Python and how to be a good programmer in the context of using computation to solve interesting problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book has three pervasive themes: systematic problem solving, the power \n",
    "of abstraction, and computation as a way of thinking about the world.\n",

    "*Programming is an intrinsically difficult activity. Just as “there is no royal\n",

In some cases, it performs a test, and on the basis of that test, execution may jump to some other point in the sequence of instructions.
